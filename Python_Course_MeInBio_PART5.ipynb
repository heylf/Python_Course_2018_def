For example, imagine we have a DNA sequence and we want to print it to the screen if the sequence is longer than 300 bp. Or imagine we have a count table (from an RNA-Seq experiment) with the number of reads mapped to each gene and we want our program to discard a gene if that gene has less that 10 reads mapped to it. \n",
